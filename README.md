üêº Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools that can handle large and complex datasets with ease.
üëâ Here are some basic operations you can perform with pandas:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Loading data: Pandas can read data from a variety of sources, including CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, and SQL databases. Use the read_csv(), read_excel(), or read_sql() functions to load your data into a pandas DataFrame.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Filtering data: Use boolean indexing to filter rows of a DataFrame based on a condition. For example, to select all rows where the value in column A is greater than 10, you can use df[df['A'] > 10].
3Ô∏è‚É£ Grouping data: Use the groupby() function to group your data by one or more columns and apply an aggregation function, such as sum(), mean(), or count(). For example, to group your data by the values in column A and compute the sum of column B for each group, you can use df.groupby('A')['B'].sum().
4Ô∏è‚É£ Joining data: Use the merge() function to combine two or more DataFrames based on a common column. For example, to join two DataFrames df1 and df2 on the column key, you can use pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key').
5Ô∏è‚É£ Reshaping data: Use the pivot() or melt() functions to reshape your data from wide to long or from long to wide format. For example, to pivot a DataFrame df on the values in column A and the columns in column B, you can use df.pivot(index='A', columns='B', values='C').
üë®‚Äçüíª Pandas is an essential library for data manipulation in Python, and these are just a few examples of its capabilities. Stay tuned for more pandas tips and tricks!
